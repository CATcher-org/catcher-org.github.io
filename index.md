**CAT**cher is a software application to be used for **C**rowd-sourced **A**nonymous **T**esting of software, for educational use in particular. It uses GitHub as the backend for hosting bug reports but provides a more optimized UI for students/instructors taking part in software testing exercises.

CATcher is being developed at [NUS SoC](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), and is used to improve/evaluate software testing skills of students in several software engineering modules at SoC. Main technologies used in CATcher are TypeScript, Angular, and Electron.
