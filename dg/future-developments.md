# Future Developments
Here are a few suggestions that future developers can work on to improve this application!

1. [Support Commenting](#support-commenting)

## Support Commenting
Currently, the application only support 1 response for each phase. So a commenting section would be good to allow discussions between team members as well as between tutors and admins.

<div class="clearfix">

    <span class="float-left">
      <a class="btn btn-light" href="{{ baseUrl }}/dg/workflow.html">
        <span aria-hidden="true" class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-left"></span>
        <span> Workflow of CATcher </span>
