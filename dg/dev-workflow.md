# Dev workflow

Given below are some guidelines to follow when submitting PRs.

---

## Choosing an issue

* Issues in CATcher that are marked as `good first issue` can serve as good starting ground for new developers. They can be found [here](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/labels/good%20first%20issue).
* Before starting on the issues, please ask the dev team (by posting a comment on the issue itself) if it is OK to work on that issue (because it is possible that an issue in the issue tracker is not suitable for implementation just yet).

---
## Submitting PRs

* A Pull Request should include the following information:
  1. A summary of what the PR does
  2. A description of the changes made
  3. A proposed commit message to be used when the PR is merged

  You can refer to the following sample pull request template or existing pull request [#675](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/pull/675), [#668](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/pull/668) for your PRs.

  ```
