# Dev workflow

Given below are some guidelines to follow when submitting PRs.

---

## Choosing an issue

* Issues in CATcher that are marked as `good first issue` can serve as good starting ground for new developers. They can be found [here](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/labels/good%20first%20issue).
* Before starting on the issues, please ask the dev team (by posting a comment on the issue itself) if it is OK to work on that issue (because it is possible that an issue in the issue tracker is not suitable for implementation just yet).

---
## Submitting PRs

* When you submit a PR, also propose a commit message to be used when the PR is merged eventually. You can include the proposed commit message in the PR description.<br>
  Follow [these se-edu guidelines](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html) when proposing the commit message.
