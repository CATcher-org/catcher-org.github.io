## Setting up repositories

For each phase, users with write access will be able to upload files (e.g. screenshots, .txt files, etc...) onto the repository's `/file` folder. These files are used in conjunction with issue description and comments in a form of a link. As for images, the actual image will be displayed.

Instructors will have to create the following repositories:
* Settings repository
* Profile repository
* Repositories for holding processed bug reports

The following repositories will be created automatically by CATcher:
* Repositories for collecting initial bug reports


#### Settings repository
* Suggested name: `module-org/pe`
* The name of this repository must be stated in the application during login. This repository must contain a **`data.csv`** and a **`settings.json`** file.
* **`data.csv`**
  * Must contain the following information:
    1. Roles of users. (Student, Tutor, Admin)
    2. Student's team allocation.
    3. Tutor's team allocation.

* **`settings.json`**:
  * Must contain the following information:
    1. The list of open phases represented by `"openPhases": []`.
    2. The name of the repository that each phase is to utilize.
  * Example https://github.com/CATcher-org/public_data/blob/master/settings.json

This repository must contain a **`profiles.json`** file.

* **`profiles.json`**
  * Must contain the following information:
    1. Profile Name
    2. Name of Settings repository

#### Repositories for collecting initial bug reports

The repositories used for initial bug reporting will be created automatically by CATcher, in the tester's own GitHub account e.g., `user/pe`. The same repo will be used during the tester-response phase.

#### Repositories for holding processed bug reports
* A private repo to host collected bug reports e.g., `module-org/pe-interim`.
* A repo to host anonymized bug reports for dev teams to respond to e.g., `module-org/pe-dev-response`<br>
  This must be a public repo with write access given to students.
* A repo to hold bugs for tutors to moderate e.g., `module-org/pe-moderation`<br>
  This can be a private repo with write access given to tutors.
  

## Creating a session link for students

A list of profiles can be modified in the Profile repository. 

To create a session link, instructors will need to encode this url `https://catcher-org.github.io/CATcher/?session=PROFILE_NAME` where `PROFILE_NAME` is the profile name of the session. This profile name must correspond exactly to the profile name in the Profile repository. 

For example, for profile name `"CS2103/T Alpha Test"`, the url will be `https://catcher-org.github.io/CATcher/?session=CS2103%2FT%20Alpha%20Test`.

If the profile name is valid, students can access the link to select the corresponding session automatically. Students can then click the **Submit** button to enter the intended session without selecting from the dropdown.
