## Using the Web app

The CATcher web app can be accessed at https://catcher-org.github.io/CATcher. Please ensure your browser does not block pop-up windows from our web app.

Ad-blockers may need to be disabled if they block pop-ups.

### Safari users

Pop-up windows are blocked by default on Safari. Before launching CATcher, please enable pop-ups by following the steps below:

1. Go to Preferences > Websites > Pop-up Windows
2. For website `catcher-org.github.io`, choose option `Allow`
   ![enable-popup](../images/safari-allow-popups.png)

##  Reporting problems

If you face any issue in using CATcher, you can create a new issue in [CATcher issue tracker](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/issues).

If possible, also provide us with the log file saved by CATcher. For the web app, logs are saved in your browser and can be retrieved by clicking the "`Download Log`"button.
